# c-tutorial

My own tutorial for c/c++.

You can compile and run c/c++ programs as well as run them on jupyter notebook.

## How to compile and run

### C

```
gcc hello.c -o hello & ./hello
```

### C

```
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
```

## Notes

On jupyter notebook, c/c++ programs can be run by using xeus-cling. It offers c++11, 14, and 17, but as far as I could tell only 11 worked correctly.

Choose xcpp11 from the kernel.
